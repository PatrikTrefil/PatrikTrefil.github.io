      <description>Out of Style The world we live in today is a complicated, fast-paced place with many problems. I want to dedicate this essay to the environmental and ethical issues while keeping the focus predominantly on (fast) fashion and its impacts. I consider raising awareness about consumerism and the materialistic character of society vital, since it may very well destroy our planet. Fast fashion is, by its definition, a production of inexpensive clothing by mass-market retailers in response to the latest trends.</description>

      <description>Good or bad? Have you ever asked yourself the question where does the ability to decide what is and is not moral come from? What has shaped our moral beliefs? Is our moral code determined more by our genetics or by our environment we live in ? All of these are difficult questions and I am going to attempt to answer them in this text. This essay is going to explore the impacts of genetics, religion and culture, environment and upbringing on human&amp;rsquo;s moral principles.</description>

      <description>Limit(less) Potential is defined as someone&amp;rsquo;s or something&amp;rsquo;s ability to develop, achieve, or succeed according to the Cambridge English Dictionary. In this essay, I would like to focus predominantly on the potential of individuals and its limitations. This is an important topic for every single one of us, considering potential is what makes us motivated and excited about the future. I think the significance is best explained by this quote from Zig Zaglar:&amp;quot; When you catch a glimpse of your potential, that&amp;rsquo;s when passion is born.</description>
