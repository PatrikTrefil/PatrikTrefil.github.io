# Personal Blog

This is the source code of my personal blog, which you can <a href="https://patriktrefil.com" target="blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

I am using <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="blank" rel="noopener">Hugo</a> to build my site. Everything is managed via git. I don't use a CMS at the moment.
