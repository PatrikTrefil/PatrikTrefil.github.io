<p>Potential is defined as <em>someone&rsquo;s or something&rsquo;s ability to develop,
achieve, or succeed</em> according to the Cambridge English Dictionary. In
this essay, I would like to focus predominantly on the potential of
individuals and its limitations. This is an important topic for every
single one of us, considering potential is what makes us motivated and
excited about the future. I think the significance is best explained by
this quote from Zig Zaglar:&quot; When you catch a glimpse of your potential,
that&rsquo;s when passion is born.&quot;. The purpose of this essay is to discuss
the factors which impact human potential most.</p>
<p>Our development has reached great heights, we have built up so much
momentum that it seems almost impossible there would exist an end of it.
New science discoveries are made every day, new sport records are broken
incredibly often. Will this ever stop? Not to mention, communication and
traveling are extraordinarily easy nowadays. These tools are indeed
useful to fulfil one&rsquo;s potential.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there are still things that hold us back. Firstly, I would
like to talk about the social aspect. The life path is pretty much set
for everyone. Everyone is expected to go to kindergarten, school,
university, get a job, work like there is no tomorrow and rest during
pension. This is good for some people, but limiting for others. Since
this is what is expected of us, it is really hard to break the stigma
that is associated with doing things differently. Do not get me wrong,
the society is more supportive of unconventional people and freedom of
thought is greater than ever before, but there is still room for
improvement. Just one of the examples are multipotentialites. These
people change their interests, hobbies even occupations very often. This
approach to life would probably be frowned upon by majority of people.
But, what these people do not realize is that they can bring tremendous
amounts of value into work teams. Providing they are experienced in
various fields they would be able give great insights, that would
otherwise remain hidden.</p>
<p>Also, our planet has limited resources and so far, we have not developed
good enough technologies to colonize nor even safely get to other
planets. The carelessness of politicians of our environment could be a
huge problem. Some even argue we have already missed our opportunity to
save the planet and therefore the end of human kind and its potential is
inevitable. All things considered, sustainability is crucial to keep our
progress going.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there are still many countries which do not support
entrepreneurship, new innovative projects etc.; we could talk for hours
about the potential that is being wasted, because of unsuitable
conditions in which people in the countries of the Third World live,
though that is a topic for another day. The point I am trying to make
here is that luck is involved, too. And, even if the circumstances seem
perfect, we might not be at right place at the right time to use our
potential to the fullest.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it seems like we are not anywhere near the limits of
human potential, but nothing in the whole entire universe is truly
limitless, even the universe itself is not, thus I believe, we are,
sooner or later, going to run into some issues. Nonetheless, our
potential is most likely going to far exceed our expectations, which
means we have a whole lot to look forward to.</p>
