<p>Have you ever asked yourself the question where does the ability to
decide what is and is not moral come from? What has shaped our moral
beliefs? Is our moral code determined more by our genetics or by our
environment we live in ? All of these are difficult questions and I am
going to attempt to answer them in this text. This essay is going to
explore the impacts of genetics, religion and culture, environment and
upbringing on human&rsquo;s moral principles.</p>
<p>Firstly, I would like to talk about the influence of genetics. M. J.
Crockett says there is a set of fundamental rules that makes us believe
that killing, lying, stealing etc. is always wrong. (Crockett, 2016)
They are engrained in human&rsquo;s DNA and allow almost no exception. They
can be violated in cases such as killing someone in order to save our
relative etc. (Ludden, 2016)</p>
<p>Secondly, our morals are shaped by our upbringing and environment. In a
paper from University of Oxford psychologist Jim Everett and his
colleagues on intuitive moral judgement is a claim that our intuitive
morality has been shaped by opinions of other people. They reason that
we are wired this way, because we need the approval from others, in
order for us to appear trustworthy and therefore be able to cooperate
with them, which is crucial for our own survival. (Jim, 2016) However,
there are exceptions and that is why we have two categories of people.
The first group consists of people with absolute values. These people
follow the intuitive code of ethics and are greatly influenced by their
environment. The second group has flexible morals. In some cases, they
are able to break away from their intuitions and think rationally.</p>
<p>Parents of children play a big role in child&rsquo;s moral development. It is
not an exception when families intentionally choose moral beliefs for
their children as a part of their legacy. It starts with picking their
extracurriculars but it goes way deeper, especially when it comes to
religion. Parents present various stories, songs and practices, which
can radically shift child&rsquo;s morals. (Oswalt, n.d.)</p>
<p>Last, but not least, we have culture and religion. It is apparent that
both have immense impact on society. And, it is also important to note
their changing character. A good example would be abortion. It used to
be unthinkable to deliberately stop woman&rsquo;s pregnancy once it has
already begun, but that is slowly changing as our culture evolves. We
are probably somewhere in the middle now, since there are countries
where it is completely legal to abort a child, but also countries, whose
laws do not allow it. It will be interesting to see in which direction
this goes. Values are transmitted through religion and can become an
inextricable part of one&rsquo;s identity. (Moral Development, n.d.)</p>
<p>To sum up, morality is formed by various things and it is hard to
decide, which has the biggest effect. Morality is continually changing
and the pace of it is getting faster and faster. There is no telling,
what our morality is going to look like in 100 years, we can just sit
back and watch.</p>
