<p>The world we live in today is a complicated, fast-paced place with many
problems. I want to dedicate this essay to the environmental and ethical
issues while keeping the focus predominantly on (fast) fashion and its
impacts. I consider raising awareness about consumerism and the
materialistic character of society vital, since it may very well destroy
our planet. Fast fashion is, by its definition, a production of
inexpensive clothing by mass-market retailers in response to the latest
trends. This makes for a lot of thrill for consumers, but not so much
for our environment. This text is an attempt to explain the underlying
issue and show some ways to address the issue.</p>
<p>First and foremost, we should talk about production. Products one can
buy in stores like H&amp;M or Zara are standardly manufactured somewhere in
the Third World Countries. T-Shirts usually cost about $5. You may be
asking, how is it possible to produce, deliver and advertise products
for this price? To keep the costs low, the conditions and salaries of
the workers are poor. Mass production plays a factor, as well. There are
significant amounts of excess, and most of it, instead of it being sold
for a lower price, is destroyed to preserve the prestige of the brand.
Not to mention, the transport to the other side of the planet creates an
enormous environmental cost as well.</p>
<p>So far, it seems like boycotting fast-fashion might be a solution, but
that does not get to the root of the problem. There are many companies,
whose advertising shows eco-friendly practices, which might seem amazing
at first, but we have to realize that such ads still make us purchase
more. No matter how low the product&rsquo;s carbon footprint is, there are
better options. Those are, for example, buying second-hand clothes or
not buying anything at all.</p>
<p>One approach to tackle this problem as an individual is the philosophy
of minimalism. It is the choice of less; less useless items,
essentially. This seems like a very reasonable method, but this
philosophy is currently evolving in a different direction. Sadly,
nowadays, minimalism is becoming more about aesthetics than anything
else. People living this lifestyle often buy overpriced stuff and
routinely swap the items for new ones. Does not seem like a perfect
solution after all, does it? There are other options, for instance,
essentialism, that come with similar ideas.</p>
<p>Maybe a less radical way would be to just buy less and choose well. We
could also incorporate the consideration of transparency of a brand, in
terms of workers' conditions and eco-friendly procedures. Companies like
Fair Trade specialize in labelling goods, which are sustainable, and
meet the required social and environmental standards, which makes those
products easily distinguishable.</p>
<p>Shopping to fill in the voids in our lives has become a standard, that
should be questioned. There are growing communities of people living by
philosophies such as minimalism, but the vast majority of people does
not see this as an important problem. Considering the recent events of
students marching in protest of politicians' carelessness to the
environment, I believe there is hope. Greta Thunberg, the originator of
the demonstrations, is an excellent example of someone who thinks
globally and acts locally. Is it not what we all should do?</p>
